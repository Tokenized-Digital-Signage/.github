This project has created in ETHGlobal Tokyo Hackathon.

## Project Overview
This is basically a digital twin of digital signage ads economy.
- ERC721 NFT Ads Spot Token
- ERC721 NFT Ads Contents Token
Those are associated 1:1.

### For Digital Signage Owner
For kiosk, We created browser based Web3 Signage program.
This program might fit to android TV, Raspberry Pi, Small Computers.
You just have to mint your spot token, then you can sell it on market place such as OpenSea.
We don't need middlemen. Smart Contract do everything, You can earn all of profit from your ad spot.

### For Ads Provider
You won't loose your art(ad) ownership anymore. You can sell the expired ad as NFT. Collectors must exist in the world!
But just be careful. If you want to upload your contents, You should verify(KYC) your personal information via WorldID, and you need at least 1 follower in Lens Protocol. It's a part of contents moderation, so thank you for your understanding.
